# SNPES Protocol

SNPES stands for Simple Network Protocol for Embedded Systems. Snpes was originally
designed to act as a Star Network Protocol for embedded LoRa devices, but it can be
easily modified to work with other kinds of communication devices. SNPES was born in
the author's graduation thesis for Computer Engineering at Universidade Federal de
Pernambuco in Brazil.
