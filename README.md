# SNPES Protocol

SNPES stands for Simple Network Protocol for Embedded Systems. Snpes was
originally designed to act as a Star Network Protocol for embedded LoRa
devices, but it can be easily modified to work with other kinds of 
communication devices. SNPES was born in the author's graduation thesis for
Computer Engineering at Universidade Federal de Pernambuco in Brazil.
